## About the Video Course
Welcome to the second Part of this Mastering Microservices with Java video course! With the introduction of the cloud, Java enterprise application development has moved from monolithic applications to small lightweight process-driven components called Microservices. Microservices in Java are the next big thing in designing scalable, easy-to-maintain Java applications. They not only makes app development easier, but also offer great flexibility when it comes to utilizing various resources optimally. If you want to build an enterprise-ready implementation of the microservice architecture, then this is the video for you!

In Part Two of this Mastering Microservices with Java video series, you’ll move on from Part One fundamentals and learn how to use Spring Security in your Java Microservices. You will also learn to secure your services effectively using REST Java clients and other tools. Moving on, putting all the pieces together, create a Single Page Application on Online Table Reservation System all by yourself. Familiarize yourself in learning the best practices and common principles of a Microservice Design and finally, explore the techniques to troubleshoot and debug the issues faced during development. 

By the end of this second Mastering Microservices with Java series, you will be confident in building smaller, lighter, and faster services that can be implemented easily in a production environment.
